Multi-Class Brain Tumor Classification using Custom Convolution Neural Networks (CNN)
Brain tumors are among the most aggressive and deadly diseases worldwide. The early and accurate diagnosis of brain tumors is critical for treatment planning and patient survival. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the standard modality for brain tumor diagnosis; however, the manual interpretation of MRI scans is time-consuming, prone to human error, and subject to inter-observer variability. In developing regions with limited access to specialized radiologists, these delays can be fatal.There is an urgent need for automated, intelligent systems that can assist medical professionals by rapidly classifying brain MRI scans into specific tumor categories (e.g., Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary) or identifying healthy tissue. This project aims to solve this problem by developing a robust, custom Deep Learning model capable of multi-class classification from scratch, ensuring high accuracy without the computational overhead of massive pre-trained models.
